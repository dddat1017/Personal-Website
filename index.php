                    <p>Hey! My name is Dat, I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Washington studying Computer
                    Science. Previously, I was an intern at Microsoft and Port of Seattle, and I graduated with high distinction from
                    Bellevue College where I earned my Associate of Arts and Sciences. Before coming to UW, I held positions as a Peer
                    Advisor, Student Government Treasurer, and even as an IT Service Desk Agent. In my free time, I'm an advent Candy 
                    Crusher, frisbee slinger, and occasional hiker. I look forward to learning and gaining more hands-on experience as 
                    I'm eager to make an impact in this world of technology. My goal is to spend a lot more time researching and 
                    developing the ideas and theories that interest me the most, and share everything that I learn onto this site.</p>

                    <br>Worked on the Data + AI Team under Visual Studio Dev Tools. Launched and maintained a machine learning 
                        contest platform, empowering developers and data scientists alike to cooperate and solve problems through 
                        building novel machine learning models. Engineered Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery to automate 
                        our teamâ€™s process of going from new commits in the source code to live production, eliminating much of 
                        the initial manual overhead involving dev environment setup and testing. Built a contest-winning Seq2Seq 
                        Frequency Model to predict Python code based on 2,000 top-starred GitHub repos. Learned to utilize Azure 
                        cloud services (DevOps, Pipelines, Resources, etc.), leverage open-source, and commit quality code.

                        cargo and aircraft images at Sea-Tac Airport. Security cameras are then implemented to accurately detect 
                        the cargo and aircrafts on the airfield, ensuring proper operations. Additionally defined and implemented 
                        a Facial Detection and Recognition system to further enhance skills/knowledge of computer vision, a 
                        Convolutional Neural Network to classify handwritten digits, and an NLTK model to perform text sentiment 
                        analysis on Twitter tweets. Worked closely with the Solution Designs Cohort as a Project Manager to support 
                        the Airport Innovation team in building an Alexa Skills Kit for Sea-Tac Airport passengers; the Skills Kit 
                        could provide information such as flight information, checkpoint wait times, concessions, parking, and more.

                    <p>Project Insight: Sequence-to-Sequence Frequency model used to predict Python code. Dataset given consisted of tokenized Python 
                        code with method headers and invocators identified to eliminate the process of parsing on the participants' end. 
                        The goal is to give the top 5 suggestions whenever a "TOKEN_TO_PREDICT" is encountered in the tokenized files.
                        Approach was initially to use a Compact Prediction Tree but later optimized to eliminate the use of a tree in 
                        favor of a list. This is because any sequence is guaranteed to be 2 elements long with the first being the 
                        method header and the second being the method invocator. It was unncessary to traverse through a tree with 
                        every retrieval of a method invocator. Using a list allows for constant retrievals, and thus, faster when 
                        there are over hundreds of thousands of sequences (even millions). The tokenized Python code was extracted 
                        from roughly 2000 starred Github repos. Tech Stack: Python, Tree/List/Dictionary Data Structures, CPT, etc.

                    applications and special techniques. Students work with algebraic and transcendental functions.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left"><b>CS 210 - Fundamentals of Computer Science I (WI 2018, S. Farag):</b> Introduces computer science and 
                    programming for CS majors. Students learn design and implementation of algorithms and programming in a structured, 
                    modular language, with emphasis on problem solving, program design, and style.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left"><b>MATH& 151 - Calculus I (AU 2017, T. Akhlaghi):</b> Introduces the concepts of limits, derivatives, and 
                    integrals. Topics include techniques and applications of derivatives of algebraic and transcendental functions. Students 
                    begin working with antiderivatives.</p>
